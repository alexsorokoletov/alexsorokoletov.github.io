Who knows all these git commands? What is git pull? What does your git push? How do you delete a local git branch but not the server one?

There a lots of git-based tools that are visual and clear. I used those tools too. Until I did not. Because they hide the meaning and behavior of git by presenting it differently.

This is why I would like to share my tips, tricks and ways of using git efficiently, without any dependency and no mess.

I'm launching a <a href="https://gum.co/git-terminal" target="_blank">course about git</a> and how to use git efficiently. You will learn how to use git, how to solve git challenges and help others. 

You can pre-order the course here: <a href="https://gum.co/git-terminal" target="_blank">https://gum.co/git-terminal</a>

Get git educated and earn kudos by helping your team with git ðŸ’ª!

The course will go live on February 1, 2021 and you can preorder it using the link above.

Let me know what questions do you have around git, what tools have you used and what bothers you with git.
