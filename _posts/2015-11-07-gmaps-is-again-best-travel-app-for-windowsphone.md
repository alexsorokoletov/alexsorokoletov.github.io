I recently opened Store app on Lumia 925 and was surprised.  
Turns out, after so many years, gMaps is still the best navigation app out there.

gMaps is top 1 free navigation application for Windows Phone 8.1! Yay!

:rocket:

gMaps Pro (paid version already including all features of gMaps) is top 2 paid navigation application for Windows Phone 8.1

Here you are, facts :)

We put a lot of energy into gMaps and are striving for the quality and features.
