I recently opened Store app on Lumia 925 and was surprised.
Turns out, after so many years, gMaps is still the best navigation app out there. 

gMaps is top 1 free navigation application for Windows Phone 8.1 
Yay!

gMaps Pro (paid version already including all features of gMaps) is top 2 paid navigation application for Windows Phone 8.1

Here you are, facts :)

We put a lot of energy into gMaps and are striving for the quality and features.
